# spASIC Experiment Testing

&copy; 2025 Pat Deegan, [https://psychogenic.com](https://psychogenic.com)

A system to allow you to develop and test your spASIC experiments on TT demoboards.

With this framework, you can easily design your experiment to run (in SPACE!) on the experiment module.


# ðŸŽµ What Are We Testing in Space?

Once built just to sing ðŸŽ¶, now itâ€™s chasing a dream,  To perform in the stars with a soft cosmic gleam âœ¨  
Thanks to TinyTapeout 06 and HUNITY's flight,  Our chipâ€™s headed to space on a satellite! ðŸš€  
Who knowsâ€”an alien drifting nearby  Might hear our tune as it floats through the sky ðŸ‘½

But don't you worry, weâ€™re tracking the pins,  In case someone out there tries muting our hymns! ðŸŽ¼

Weâ€™re also sending some sneaky clues in codeâ€”  
*easter eggs* that may take a few orbits to fully decode... ðŸ‘€

# ðŸ“¡ How to Decode Payload Received from Space

Due to bandwidth constraints, we're limited to sending just **10 bytes** of data at a time. But with the help of **QubitText-Compressor**! ðŸš€

Table:
```a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z,space```
